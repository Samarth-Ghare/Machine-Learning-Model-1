# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm or data analysis technique, demonstrating key concepts and practical applications.

## Projects

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier (ml1Decisiontree.ipynb)

This notebook implements a Decision Tree Classifier, a fundamental algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The project utilizes the well-known Iris dataset to demonstrate the complete machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation.

**Key Features:**
* Loading and inspecting the Iris dataset.
* Splitting data into training and testing sets.
* Training a Decision Tree Classifier.
* Evaluating model performance using a Confusion Matrix and Classification Report.

**Technologies Used:**
* `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and utilities.
* `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
* `numpy` for numerical operations.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (ml2KNN.ipynb)

This notebook explores the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm often used for classification and regression. The project focuses on customer categorization based on various demographic and usage attributes. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, likely with an emphasis on determining the optimal 'k' value for the best accuracy.

**Key Features:**
* Data loading and initial exploration of customer data.
* Data preprocessing techniques.
* Implementing and training a KNN classifier.
* Evaluating model accuracy and potentially optimizing the 'k' parameter.

**Technologies Used:**
* `numpy` for numerical operations.
* `matplotlib` for data visualization.
* `pandas` for data manipulation.
* `scikit-learn` for preprocessing and KNN model implementation.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (ml3EDA.ipynb)

This notebook performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset, which appears to be related to the Titanic passenger information. EDA is a crucial first step in any data science project, allowing for a deeper understanding of the data's structure, patterns, anomalies, and relationships.

**Key Features:**
* Loading and initial inspection of the dataset (e.g., `PassengerId`, `Survived`, `Name`, `Age`, `Sex`, `Pclass`).
* Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
* Statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover insights.
* Feature engineering or transformation (e.g., one-hot encoding for 'Sex', label encoding for 'Pclass').

**Technologies Used:**
* `pandas` for data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
* (Potentially `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations, though not explicitly shown in snippets, these are common for EDA).
